# Olist E-commerce Dashboard

## Project Overview

The Olist E-commerce Dashboard aims to provide an in-depth analysis of e-commerce data using MS SQL Server for data management and Power BI for visualization. 
This project covers the end-to-end data pipeline from raw dataset exploration to business insights through interactive reports.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this project include:

### 1. Database Creation & Querying:

* Store and manage e-commerce datasets efficiently in MS SQL Server.

* Write SQL queries and views to extract meaningful insights.

### 2. Advanced Data Analytics & Optimization:

* Perform data cleaning, indexing, and optimization to enhance query performance.

* Implement advanced SQL techniques such as aggregations, window functions, and subqueries.

### 3. Business Insights & Decision Support:

* Analyze key business metrics such as revenue trends, customer segmentation, logistics efficiency, and marketing performance.

### 4. Interactive Dashboard Development in Power BI:

* Design a clean, insightful dashboard using DAX calculations, relationships, and custom visualizations.

* Ensure real-time interactivity with Power BIâ€™s drill-through and filter functionalities.
